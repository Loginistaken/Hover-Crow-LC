üö™ New Additions:

Turbo Flap Stability Vents: Work in sync with the kerosene jet, allowing heat-reinforced rear 
vents to pulse stabilizing backdraft.

Custom Kerosene Turbo Boost: Finalized to give punchy acceleration and preserve the Hovercrow's 
identity in high-speed hover-racing and tactical usage.

üß≤ II. SUPERCODUCTING MAGLEV HOVER SYSTEM

1. Superconducting Magnetic Repulsion

Principle: Lenz‚Äôs Law + Meissner Effect

Mechanism:

Graphene-encased coils, cooled to superconducting state, emit downward magnetic fields.

Asphalt/concrete induce opposing eddy currents, enabling repulsion-based levitation.

Cooling System: Closed-loop liquid nitrogen cycle with graphene heat spreaders.

Advantages: No rail needed, real-road compatible.

Limitations: Less effective on sand, water, or non-conductive surfaces.

System Cost:

Coils: $60,000

Cryo Housing: $55,000

Graphene Integration: $35,000‚Üí Total: $150,000

2. Quad Ducted Lift Fans

Diamond pattern

Functions:

Stabilization in pitch, roll, yaw

Boosting over weak magnetic zones

Jump-lift & evasive maneuvers

Controlled by AI with 1000+ real-time micro-adjustments/sec

üî• III. MICRO TURBOJET THRUST (CUSTOM RETAINED)

Type: Micro Kerosene Jet Turbo + Vent Vector SystemTarget Thrust: ~13.5 kN burst / 10 kN cruiseFuel: Refined kerosene (compact cell)

Why Retain This?

Delivers classic, punchy turbo-feel

Sound signature + thermal plume adds brand identity

Lightweight, refined for short sprints vs full flight

Enables high-speed thrust bursts beyond electric-only builds

Thrust Steering:

¬±45¬∞ venting rear nozzle

Integrates with flaps + side vortex vents

Total Cost: $180,000
