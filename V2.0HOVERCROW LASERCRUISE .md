🌍 VIII. ENVIRONMENTAL COMPARISON: 60-MILE RACE
Vehicle	Fuel Used	Emissions	Boost Mode	Time to 60 mi
HoverCrow (no boost)	Hydrogen-Electric	Zero	❌	26 min
HoverCrow (boost)	Hydrogen + 0.25 gal K	0.7 kg CO₂	✅	8.2 min
Gas Car	2 gal gasoline	18.6 kg CO₂	❌	63 min

    Winner (Cleanest): HoverCrow (no boost)
    Winner (Fastest): HoverCrow (boosted)
    Winner (Most Efficient): HoverCrow (no boost)

Boost logic:
Boost can only be used once per run (2.5 min max), then cooldown (6 min). Software prevents double-boost and overheating.
