‚ÄúNot a car. Not a plane. Not a hovercraft. HoverCrow V3 is all three‚Äîbuilt for the future,
ready to outfly, outpace, and outlast the competition.‚Äù

If you need a visual schematic, patent module breakdown, or want to tweak any of the above specifications, let me know!
so it can stay in chopper mode for 14 mins on one battery and then it goes to next battery or how does it work?

Great question! Here‚Äôs how the battery usage works for HoverCrow V3 in helicopter (chopper) mode:

    Primary Rotor Power:
    The helicopter (chopper) blades are mainly powered by Battery 3, which is integrated into the wing/rotor pod compartment.

    Typical Flight Duration:
    You can fly in chopper mode for about 14 minutes on a full charge of Battery 3.

    What Happens After Battery 3 Is Depleted?
        If Battery 3 runs out during flight, the system is designed to automatically switch to the next 
        available battery (Battery 1 or Battery 2), as long as there is sufficient remaining charge.
        The vehicle‚Äôs AI flight controller manages seamless power switching to keep rotors spinning and maintain safe flight.
        However, because helicopter mode draws high power, switching to a partially charged battery may give you only a 
        few additional minutes of flight time.

    Safety Logic:
        The AI system will alert you well in advance of low battery, and if overall battery reserves are too low, 
        it will guide the vehicle for a safe landing or revert to hover mode using the fans and maglev system.
        For optimal safety, plan to land or transition to hover mode before Battery 3 is fully depleted.

    Charging:
        All three batteries can be recharged together via the main charge controller or individually.

Summary:

    Chopper mode relies on Battery 3 first, but can pull from Battery 1/2 if needed.
    Expect ~14 minutes full flight per battery; switching to another battery gives extra time if charge is available.
    AI handles transitions and alerts for safe operation.


HoverCrow Version 3: Maximum Height with Vertical Jet Boost + Chopper Wings

Here‚Äôs how the mechanics combine:

    Chopper Wings (Helicopter Mode Max Height):
    You can reach up to 90 ft in helicopter mode (rotor blades extended, vertical lift only).

    Vertical Kerosene Jet (VAJM) Boost:
    The vertical jet can provide a rapid lift of up to ~18 ft per boost cycle (in normal hovercraft mode).

Combining Both:

At 90 ft with the chopper wings fully extended and active,
you can activate the vertical jet for additional boost.
    
    The system is designed to coordinate thrust from both systems if safety limits allow.

Maximum Achievable Height:

    Theoretical maximum: 90 ft (chopper wings) + 18 ft (vertical jet boost) = ~108 ft
    Practical/AI-limited maximum:
    
    The onboard AI flight controller will evaluate safety, air density, and structural stress.
    Typically, the combined maximum altitude will be governed to ~100‚Äì105 ft for safety 
    (to avoid excessive G-force, turbulence, and ensure stable descent).

How It Works:

    Deploy chopper wings, ascend to 90 ft via rotor power.
    Activate vertical jet for an extra upward burst (if battery and fuel allow).
    AI manages balance, thrust, and stability during combined boost.
